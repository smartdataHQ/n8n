# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a Kafka logging plugin for n8n that captures workflow execution events and sends them as JSON messages to a Kafka topic. The plugin is designed to be operationally safe, ensuring that Kafka connectivity issues do not impact workflow execution performance or reliability. The plugin provides comprehensive logging of workflow lifecycle events for monitoring, auditing, and analytics purposes.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to capture workflow execution events and send them to Kafka, so that I can monitor workflow performance and maintain audit logs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a workflow execution starts THEN the system SHALL send a workflow start event to the configured Kafka topic
2. WHEN a workflow execution completes successfully THEN the system SHALL send a workflow success event to the configured Kafka topic
3. WHEN a workflow execution fails THEN the system SHALL send a workflow failure event to the configured Kafka topic
4. WHEN a workflow execution is cancelled THEN the system SHALL send a workflow cancellation event to the configured Kafka topic

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the Kafka logging to be operationally safe, so that Kafka connectivity issues do not impact workflow execution.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Kafka is unavailable THEN the system SHALL continue workflow execution without blocking or throwing errors
2. WHEN Kafka message sending fails THEN the system SHALL log the failure locally and continue operation
3. WHEN Kafka connection is slow THEN the system SHALL use asynchronous messaging with timeouts to prevent workflow delays
4. WHEN the Kafka client encounters errors THEN the system SHALL implement circuit breaker pattern to prevent cascading failures

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to configure the Kafka logging plugin through environment variables, so that I can customize the logging behavior for different environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the plugin is enabled THEN the system SHALL read Kafka broker configuration from environment variables
2. WHEN topic name is configured THEN the system SHALL send messages to the specified Kafka topic
3. WHEN authentication is required THEN the system SHALL support SASL/SSL authentication configuration
4. WHEN the plugin is disabled THEN the system SHALL not attempt any Kafka operations

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want workflow execution events to contain comprehensive metadata, so that I can analyze workflow performance and troubleshoot issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN sending execution events THEN the system SHALL include workflow ID, execution ID, and timestamp
2. WHEN sending execution events THEN the system SHALL include workflow name, status, and duration
3. WHEN sending execution events THEN the system SHALL include user information and execution mode
4. WHEN sending failure events THEN the system SHALL include error details and stack trace information
5. WHEN sending events THEN the system SHALL format all data as valid JSON

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the plugin to handle message queuing and retry logic, so that temporary Kafka outages don't result in lost events.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Kafka is temporarily unavailable THEN the system SHALL queue messages in memory with a configurable size limit
2. WHEN Kafka becomes available again THEN the system SHALL attempt to send queued messages
3. WHEN the memory queue reaches capacity THEN the system SHALL drop oldest messages to prevent memory exhaustion
4. WHEN message sending fails THEN the system SHALL implement exponential backoff retry strategy with maximum retry limits

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to monitor the health of the Kafka logging plugin, so that I can ensure proper operation and troubleshoot issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the plugin is running THEN the system SHALL expose health check endpoints for monitoring
2. WHEN messages are successfully sent THEN the system SHALL increment success metrics
3. WHEN message sending fails THEN the system SHALL increment failure metrics and log error details
4. WHEN the queue size changes THEN the system SHALL track queue depth metrics for monitoring
